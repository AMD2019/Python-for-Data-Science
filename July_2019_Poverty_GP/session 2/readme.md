# Python for Data Science
# Week 2 - Further data structures, libraries and file handling
### Overview
This session goes into more depth on Python data structures, including dictionaries and tuples. We will make more use of loops and conditionals, plus write functions, to control the flow and execution of code.

### In class: code demo.
