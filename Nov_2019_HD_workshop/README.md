# Python_for_Data_Science: Human Development Group November 2019 course

# Overview
This course is for World Bank Human Development staff who need data science methods for their analytical or operational work. The instructors are Nick Jones (GFDRR Labs) and Dharana Rijal (DECAT).

__Prerequisites and format__: No prior coding experience is needed. The workshop will comprise a combination of teaching and 'lab' sessions where participants write code on their own laptops.

# Running the scripts
Two methods:
* _Beginner method:_ Click the links to 'open notebook in Colab.' (need to log in to Google account; no software installation required)
* _Preferred method:_ Install Anaconda Navigator in the folder C:\WBG from the software catalogue on eServices. Download the scripts (or clone the repository with Git) and load the notebooks (.ipynb files) in Jupyter Notebooks on your laptop.
